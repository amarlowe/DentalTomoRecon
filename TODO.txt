- In high derivative areas created by running 1k iterations with no TV, copy errors occur where black boxes appear and dissappear 
- Gain correction doesn't turn off when starting project with it on from new, then turning it off
- Reconstruction completely breaks when run in horizontal flip mode

--------------Bugs---------------------
- Zbuffs are inaccessible on host code for gpu memory cleanup
- Border artifacts in edge enhancement
- additional lines included on increasing z size
- index out of bounds and other conditions set array values to an explicit -10 (removed TV+sq)
- image edges given tails that are not explicitly dealt with
- debug mode causes a crash and failure (problem likely persists in release, it just gets ignored)
- when reading in files, it will attempt to read .dicom files along with the raw files and cause errors
- interop only supports a single buffer, code exits for any number, but swapping buffers fails (may not be necessary, already need to swap the main buffer)
- creating two instances works, fails after closing one. More cleanup is required
- TONS of magic numbers left scrambled around the CUDA code
- Making the viewport too small crashes opengl-line 110 (cudagraphicsresource has minimum size?)
- color inversion on low z layer counts (fixed with color normalization)
- Program locks up when button is pressed when the last frame is selected
- Loading more than 2 projections causes odd bugs
- Check for console tab before running reconstructions
- Y axis not checked for out of bounds, leading to white noise on top and bottom
- Number of Slices to Reconstruct too large may crash program
- No boundary checking when changing between display types (ie, out of bounds if recon has fewer slices than input and left on the final slice)
- Cancel on new does not cancel operation
- Images saved are offset by about 10 pixels, giving garbage data at the top and cutting off the bottom
- If left to run, error comes in from bottom and does not stop
- Conflict between continous mode and others
- Cuda constants are global, not object specific
- offset maximums are not calculated correctly, have overshoot
- If left untouched for some time, becomes completely unresponsive
- Zooming out then changing z distance causes a jump in offsets
- GPU memory leaks abound
- White artifacts around reconstruction corners
- Flip causes pictures to go negative, not sure if we should fix/detect
- Disable console close button
- Close behavior breaks when the console is the selected tab
- Changing config after opening image set does not update
- Histogram lighting has some issues (see rmi single)
- Toolbar settings do not update on tab change
