TomoRecon

-------------Features------------------
- File system that saves calbiration data system independently
- Fix readGainAndDarkimages
- Remove magic numbers and filepaths
- Cuda profiler compiler switch
- Implement cjson struct building
- Save and load json files based on user input
- Switch between inputs in form using tab and/or enter
- Confirm cancel or load when values have been edited
- Run program from new UI
- Check values for input before allowing running, prompt a visit to config
- Implement a visualizer on a per project basis
- output console output to status bar, include a progress meter
- Implement start page in main window with instructions
- New prompts for opening of raw files, processes and displays
- Open opens a render, not the raw files (used for self comparisons)
- Init openGl on program launch for minor speedups in first tab open
- Make MAC compiltible (hopefully not)
- Save configuration settings on project file/directory instead of registry to make them project specific
- "Set default" options for configuration and any other setting we can come up with
- Replace each failure state with it's own error type and dialoag (or pass a string)

--------------Bugs---------------------
- selecting an image runs normally with no errors
- Number of Slices to Reconstruct too large may crash program
- texture memory accesses are not locally spaced, they're scattered
- image edges given tails that are not explicitly dealt with
- Check optimization of block and grid sizes
- index out of bounds and other conditions set array values to an explicit -10
- color inversion on low z layer counts
- additional lines included on increasing z size
- debug mode causes a crash and failure (problem likely persists in release, it just gets ignored)
- wxwidget drag draws artifacts on the wrong screen
- when reading in files, it will attempt to read .dicom files along with the raw files and cause errors
- Throw all tomo errors instead of crashing the program
- Program crashes after returning error in reconstruction
