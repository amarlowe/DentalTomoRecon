TomoRecon

-------------Features------------------
- Confirm cancel or load when values have been edited
- Check values for input before allowing running, prompt a visit to config
- Make MAC compiltible (hopefully not)
- Save configuration settings on project file/directory instead of registry to make them project specific
- Replace each failure state with it's own error type and dialoag (or pass a string)
- Look into upres using the mutltiple viewing angles
- Confirm overwrite on save if file already exists
- Make an automated test bench for algorithm changes
- Correct for multipixel surface defects
- Gui tools for translating scales into real world measurments
- Image annotations
- Remove focus artifacts, only show in focus areas
- Use autofocus to generate relative geometries
- Move autodetect geometry to config menu, grey out geo list when this is selected
- Make input selections a wizard
- Correct for non-xy shifts in the detector
- Save projection images after processing
- Save all toolbar settings for session end
- Add DICOM read functions
- Use a texture gather to detect 0s that would be used in bilinear filtering to further remove artifacts

--------------Bugs---------------------

- Zbuffs are inaccessible on host code for gpu memory cleanup

-------------Completed------------------
-------------Features------------------
- Move sys generation to initializer
- Fix readGainAndDarkimages
- Remove magic numbers and filepaths
- Implement cjson struct building
- Save and load json files based on user input
- Implement a visualizer on a per project basis
- output console output to status bar, include a progress meter
- Implement start page in main window with instructions
- New prompts for opening of raw files, processes and displays
- Init openGl on program launch for minor speedups in first tab open
- Only allow one config window to be open at a time 
- Corrected edge ringing by adapdtive error normalization
- Evaluate need to iterate through captures instead of all at once
- Add timers to reconstructions
- Made recons continuous instead of batch
- Look at the lighting change from the first to others (made a basic color corrector based on averages)
- Include distance to the detector in status bar
- Zoom with ctrl + mouse wheel
- Drag to move around in zoomed in space
- Zoom targets current mouse position as center
- Alt + wheel to change lighting
- Automatic phantom reader
- Color correction within current viewport
- Make a labled and colored rectangular selection tool
- Inefficienicies in initial load and correction, can remove the final blur step and blurxy array
- Recon norm has essentially uniform values across the entire image, consider killing to save memory (incorrect value was being read from it in the past)
- Clean up all non-recon memory when recon finishes
- Siphon mem from open recons by reading from disk and just having a buffer of slices (turned into just a single slice recon)
- Make a dialoag box that adds selections
- Recon artifacts are occuring whenever there are high derivative areas, if a lossy filter is a solution, make it optional (removed backprojection)
- Need to rescale lighting to accent constrast, possibly with HDR algorigthms (imageJ win+lvl)
- Window and lighting adjustment presets for diffent diagnosis types (autoadjustment based on selections)
- Add a display and save filter for log values
- Add popup for vertial or horizontal phantom orientation
- Calculate relative distances given a baseline with approximate geometries
- Remove internal pixel buffer in favor of generating everything on the fly
- Redo read-raw-projections for speed, stability, and color correction accuracy
- Correct for scan lines
- Switch to single buffer as the output, calculate pitch widths from pixel ratios
- Built toolbars for user parameters
- Edit lighting and contrast panel
- Switch between inputs in form using tab and/or enter
- Add Units to all number descriptions in settings 
- Save recon as DICOM from reconstruction mode
- Correct for dead pixels
- Name tabs based on filename
- Throw all tomo errors instead of crashing the program

--------------Bugs---------------------
- additional lines included on increasing z size
- index out of bounds and other conditions set array values to an explicit -10 (removed TV+sq)
- image edges given tails that are not explicitly dealt with
- debug mode causes a crash and failure (problem likely persists in release, it just gets ignored)
- when reading in files, it will attempt to read .dicom files along with the raw files and cause errors
- interop only supports a single buffer, code exits for any number, but swapping buffers fails (may not be necessary, already need to swap the main buffer)
- creating two instances works, fails after closing one. More cleanup is required
- TONS of magic numbers left scrambled around the CUDA code
- Making the viewport too small crashes opengl-line 110 (cudagraphicsresource has minimum size?)
- color inversion on low z layer counts (fixed with color normalization)
- Program locks up when button is pressed when the last frame is selected
- Loading more than 2 projections causes odd bugs
- Check for console tab before running reconstructions
- Y axis not checked for out of bounds, leading to white noise on top and bottom
- Number of Slices to Reconstruct too large may crash program
- No boundary checking when changing between display types (ie, out of bounds if recon has fewer slices than input and left on the final slice)
- Cancel on new does not cancel operation
- Images saved are offset by about 10 pixels, giving garbage data at the top and cutting off the bottom
- If left to run, error comes in from bottom and does not stop
- Conflict between continous mode and others
- Cuda constants are global, not object specific
- offset maximums are not calculated correctly, have overshoot
- If left untouched for some time, becomes completely unresponsive
- Zooming out then changing z distance causes a jump in offsets
- GPU memory leaks abound
- White artifacts around reconstruction corners
- Flip causes pictures to go negative, not sure if we should fix/detect
- Disable console close button
- Close behavior breaks when the console is the selected tab
- Changing config after opening image set does not update
- Histogram lighting has some issues (see rmi single)
- Toolbar settings do not update on tab change
